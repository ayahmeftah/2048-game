**2048** is a classic single-player puzzle game where the player combines numbered tiles by sliding them in four directions (up, down, left, right) to reach the elusive **2048 tile**. Each move merges tiles with the same number, doubling their value and increasing the challenge as the board fills up.

I chose to recreate the 2048 game because Iâ€™ve always loved how simple yet addictive it is. It also seemed like a fun challenge to implement using JavaScript, especially handling the tile merging logic and game-over conditions.
